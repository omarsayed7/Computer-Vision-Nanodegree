## Project 1: Facial Keypoint Detection

[Facial Keypoint Detection Project](P1_Facial_Keypoints)<br/>

In this project, I combined knowledge of computer vision techniques and deep learning architectures to build a facial keypoint detection system that takes in any image with faces, and predicts the location of 68 distinguishing keypoints on each face.

## Project 2: Image Captioning

[Image Captioning Project](P2_Image_Captioning)<br/>

In this project, I design and train a CNN-RNN (Convolutional Neural Network - Recurrent Neural Network) model for  automatically generating image captions. The network is trained on the Microsoft Common Objects in COntext [(MS COCO)](http://cocodataset.org/#home) dataset. The image captioning model is displayed below.

## Project 3: Landmark Detection

[Landmark Detection Project](https://github.com/omarsayed7/Computer-Vision-Nanodegree/tree/master/P3_Landmark%20Detection%20%26%20Tracking%20(SLAM))<br/>

In this project, I implemented SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) for a 2 dimensional world! ,combined what i know about robot sensor measurements and movement to create a map of an environment from only sensor and motion data gathered by a robot, over time. SLAM gives a way to track the location of a robot in the world in real-time and identify the locations of landmarks such as buildings, trees, rocks, and other world features. This is an active area of research in the fields of robotics and autonomous systems.
